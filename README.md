# Tie the knot

This was as personal project that I made for my Wedding. The goal was to my guests share photos with us(me & wife) easily. It was like a public gallery. Everyone could see all the photos that were being shared. No accounts or other shenanigans. "Go to this website and upload it from your phone!"
